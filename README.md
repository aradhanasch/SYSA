# SYSA
SYSA: Sync Your Safe Arrival is a ride-sharing application designed to enhance safety and trust among travelers by offering features like a women-only travel option, real-time location sharing, and profession-based travel grouping. Built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Kotlin for the backend, and Firebase as the database, it ensures secure authentication via  OTP verification. To run the project, clone the repository, install dependencies using npm install, and start both the backend and frontend servers. The project is structured into frontend, backend, and database components, ensuring a modular approach. Developed by four batchmates as a college project, future improvements include AI-based safety alerts, multi-language support, and public transport integration. This project is strictly for educational purposes and is not intended for commercial use.
